Some people believe that taking risks is the quickest way to reach their goals. However, I think that careful planning is a more reliable and effective path to success.\nTo begin with, taking risks often brings great uncertainty. When people choose a risky approach, they may face heavy pressure and unexpected challenges. This not only requires strong professional skills, but also a high level of mental endurance. For many individuals, such stress can easily lead to failure rather than success.\nIn contrast, careful planning provides a clear direction. Before taking action, we can analyze our strengths, understand possible difficulties, and make practical steps. During the process, a well-designed plan also helps us monitor our progress and adjust our methods when necessary. As a result, we are more likely to achieve our goals steadily and confidently. For example, when preparing for job applications, people who plan ahead—by researching companies and practicing interviews—usually perform better than those who simply act without preparation.\nIn conclusion, although risk-taking may bring quick results for a few people, I believe that success is more firmly rooted in thoughtful planning. A clear and realistic plan guides us forward and increases the chances of long-term achievement.\n这个差别不是一般的大。\n还有它提供的模版,分为引言模板 + 主体段落模板 + 结论模板 + 常用句式模板。\n【引言模板】Introduction Templates\n模板 1：背景 + 题目重述 + 观点 Recently, the topic of ___ has attracted increasing attention.
